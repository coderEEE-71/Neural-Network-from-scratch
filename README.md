# Neural-Network-from-scratch
I have constructed two neural networks, one without a hidden layer and the other with a single hidden layer consisting of four neurons, from the ground up. 
This approach is intended to facilitate a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts of neural networks. 
Additionally, I have included handwritten notes that highlight the mathematical derivation of both the forward propagation and back propagation processes.
